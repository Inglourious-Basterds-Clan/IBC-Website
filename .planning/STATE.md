# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-10-02)

**Core value:** A Polish player searching for an Arma 3 milsim clan (or for "IBC" by name) finds this site, understands what IBC is and how to join, and clicks through to Discord.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — Eleventy Foundation

## Current Position

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 5 phases. Phases 2 (SEO) and 3 (Performance) both depend only on Phase 1 and can run in parallel.
- [Roadmap]: PERF-08 (Lighthouse ≥ 90 on every page) is verified in Phase 5, after the visual refresh.
- [Roadmap]: SEO-06 (breadcrumbs) is delivered in Phase 4, when subpages first exist.
- [Roadmap]: Roster (`/sklad/`, ROST-*) is v2 and not in this roadmap.
- [Phase 01]: Baseline section screenshots use Chrome DevTools protocol (scrollIntoView + capture); headless --screenshot ignores #hash scrolling
- [Phase 01]: test/helpers.js build() strips SITE_URL/PATH_PREFIX/INCLUDE_DEV_PAGES/ELEVENTY_RUN_MODE case-insensitively before merging the variant env

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 1]: The deploy target changes from the repo root to `_site/`. The user must be told and the change documented.
- [Phase 1/2]: Domain and host are unknown. Decide whether to deploy before the domain exists (GitHub Pages subpath → pathPrefix + noindex).
- [Phase 3/5]: Share Tech Mono has no Polish glyphs. Phase 3 self-hosts fonts with Polish coverage (interim mono if needed); the Phase 5 UI-SPEC makes the final HUD font choice.
- [Phase 4]: Needs clan facts from the user (schedule, modpack, DLC, join steps, play style, honest member metric) to confirm in FACTS.md.
- [Phase 2/4]: The TODO-marker gate (SEO-08) should fail production builds only, so Phase 4 drafting can still build in dev.
- [Phase 5]: Run `/gsd-ui-phase` first (UI-SPEC: identity inventory, effect budget, HUD font).
